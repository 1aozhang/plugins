# Recommended Plugins

Those are the plugins recommended by the Joplin team because they meet our standards for security and performance.

Currently there is no review process so the selected plugins are those developed by either the Joplin team or by frequent contributors.

In the future, there may be a review process so that other plugins can be submitted and potentially have the Recommended tag too.
